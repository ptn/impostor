      # This method only parsers the subject of the mail, the body is parsed by
      # methods called the same as the command. These methods are invoked by
      # the dispatcher called #parse_body and return a hash that map the name
      # of a parameter to it's value. If a body parser is not provided for a
      # given command, the method called #default_body_parser is invoked, which
      # returns a map with a single key :matched_text mapping to the complete
      # body of the email.
      #
      # Returns the name of the command, the issuing user, the game and the
      # parameters hash.

      # FIXME: breaks with HTML, should strip signatures, etc.
